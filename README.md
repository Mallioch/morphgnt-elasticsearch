# morphgnt-elasticsearch

This project is a little experiment of mine. I needed to learn Elasticsearch and wanted to experiment with something other than data at work. So I figured I would see what I could get out of Elasticsearch loaded up with some [morphgnt](http://morphgnt.org/) data.

At this point I am experimenting and [writing queries](query-notes.md). More to come soon.
